To create a responsive CSS grid that alters the number of image columns based on the device width, as you correctly surmised, you can indeed use the auto-fit and minmax() functions in combination with the repeat() function.

Lets break this down:

grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr)); The repeat() function allows you to repeat columns as many times as needed. auto-fill fills the grid with as many columns as it can fit without overflowing.
minmax(300px, 1fr): This function dictates the minimum and maximum size of the grid column. 300px is the minimum size, and 1fr is the maximum size. It means the image will have a minimum width of 300px but can grow to take up available free space if it's there.
To make thiss grid responsive, youll need to make use of CSS media queries. You can make the grid switch from 1 column to 2 columns once the minimum width of the device (viewport) is 768px, and from 2 to 3 columns when the minimum width reaches 1024px.

Heres how you could set it up:

.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 10px; // space between items
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(400px, 1fr));
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(500px, 1fr));
  }
}
In this example, a 300px minimum column width is used for mobile devices, 400px for tablets, and 500px for desktop. Remember to place your media queries at the bottom, because CSS applies the last rule it finds that matches a given element.

Also, the gap property gives the space between the grid items.

Lastly, make sure to adjust the minmax value based on the size and resolution of the images you're using, the number of columns you want to show, and the look and feel you're trying to achieve.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions
