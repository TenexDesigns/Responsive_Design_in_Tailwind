what is the ch unit
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In CSS, "ch" is a unit of measurement that represents the width of the character "0" (zero) in the current font.
  It is a relative unit, meaning its value depends on the font being used.

The "ch" unit can be useful for creating layouts that are based on character width,
  especially when you want to ensure that text elements align properly or have consistent spacing regardless of the font being used.

Heres an example of how you can use the "ch" unit in CSS:

.example {
  width: 20ch; /* The width will be 20 times the width of the "0" character */
  padding: 1ch; /* The padding will be 1 times the width of the "0" character */
  font-size: 1.2ch; /* The font size will be 1.2 times the width of the "0" character */
}
Note that the "ch" unit is supported in most modern browsers, but it may not work as expected in older browsers. 
  Its always a good practice to test your CSS code across different browsers to ensure compatibility.





Is it true in typography thatyou should enure that the number of charcters in  a line is no more than 75, and in the above context of ch, does ch help in doing theis, setting the width of e.g a paragraph to maybe 75ch will limit the width of that paragraph to 75 characters, Is this a goo approach or should I use percentes or rem
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In typography, there is a general guideline that suggests keeping the number of characters per line between 45 to 75 for optimal readability. However, this guideline is not a strict rule and can vary depending on the context, font size, and line height.

Using the "ch" unit to set the width of a paragraph to a specific number of characters can be a viable approach to limit the line length. It ensures that the paragraphs width corresponds to a certain number of characters, which can help maintain readability within the recommended range.

However, its worth noting that the "ch" unit has some limitations. It calculates the width based on the character "0" and assumes that all characters have the same width. In reality, different characters can have varying widths, especially in proportional fonts. So while using "ch" can provide an approximate estimate, it may not guarantee an exact character count.

In terms of choosing between percentages, "rem" (root em), or "ch" units, it depends on your specific requirements and the behavior you want to achieve. Percentages and "rem" units are better suited for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes, while "ch" units are more focused on controlling the width based on character count.

If your goal is to limit the line length to a specific number of characters, using "ch" can be a reasonable approach. However, its always a good idea to test and adjust the value based on the actual rendering in different browsers and devices to ensure the desired readability and appearance.
