To make the text div fill the space left by the red box when it wraps to the next line, you can use the flex-grow class in Tailwind CSS. This class will make the text div grow and fill the available space in the flex container.

Heres the updated code with the flex-grow class applied to the text div:

html
Copy code
<div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between">
  <div class="w-1/3 flex-grow">
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. ...
    <!-- Your other buttons here -->
  </div>

  <div class="w-1/3 h-[300px] min-w-[500px] bg-red-400">
    3
  </div>
</div>
By adding the flex-grow class to the text div, it will expand and take up the available space in the flex container when the red box wraps to the next line. The flex-grow class applies a flex-grow: 1 CSS property, which tells the flex item to grow and fill the remaining space in the flex container.

With this change, the text div will automatically adjust its width to fill the space left by the red box when the red box wraps to the next line, ensuring that the layout remains responsive and visually appealing.

  In order to make the text div fill the remaining space when the red div wraps to the next line, you should utilize the flex-grow property of flexbox layout in CSS. This property specifies how much available space inside the flex container your item should take up.

In Tailwind CSS, you can use the flex-grow utility to achieve this. Here is how you can adjust your existing code:

<div class="flex flex-wrap">
  <div class="w-1/3 flex-grow">
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit... (your text continues here)
    <button class="bg-blue-400"> Hello</button>
    <button class="bg-red-400"> Hello</button>
    <button class="bg-red-400"> Hello</button>
  </div>
  <div class="w-1/3 h-[300px] min-w-[500px] bg-red-400">
    3
  </div>
</div>
By using the flex-grow class in your text div, you are allowing it to take up any remaining space in the row when your red div wraps to the next line. Note that you should remove the justify-between from the container div since it could force a space between your items when the text div tries to expand, which could stop the text div from filling all the available space.

Remember, flex-grow will allow the div to grow and take extra space if there is any. If you want to control this behavior at various sizes, you can use Tailwinds responsive design utilities. For instance, to allow the div to grow at medium-sized screens and above, use md:flex-grow.

Always remember to check your design in various viewport sizes to make sure it is displaying as expectedâ€”this is important when you are working with properties like flex-grow that deal with available space.
