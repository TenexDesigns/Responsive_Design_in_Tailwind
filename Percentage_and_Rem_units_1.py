In CSS, both percentages and rem units can be used to create responsive designs, but they work in different ways and are used for different purposes.

1.Percentages (%):

Percentages in CSS are relative to the size of the parent element. For example, if you set the width of an element to 50%, 
it will take up half of the width of its parent element. This can be very useful for creating layouts that adapt to the size of the viewport 
  or the size of a containing element.

Here's an example of how you can use percentages:

.container {
  width: 80%; /* The container will take up 80% of the width of its parent element */
}

.child {
  width: 50%; /* The child will take up 50% of the width of the container */
}
In this example, the .child element will take up 50% of the width of the .container element, 
not 50% of the width of the viewport or the parent of the .container element.


Percentages:---use percentages for widths and heights to create a responsive layout,

Widths: Using percentages for widths enables fluid and responsive layouts. By setting an element's width to a percentage, it will adapt proportionally to its parent container's size, creating a flexible design that adjusts to different screen sizes.
Heights: Percentages can also be used for heights, but its important to ensure that the parent container has a specified height to establish a reference for the percentage calculation. Percentage heights are useful when you want elements to dynamically adjust their height relative to the parent container.




  
2.Rem units:

Rem units, on the other hand, are relative to the root font size (the font size of the html element).
This is like a fixed width. It is set in stone , depending on the number of pexels assigned to it. It is fixed , so use it for spacing,padding,margin, border ,line heroght, but not foe width and height.
 This makes them very useful for setting font sizes, margins, paddings, line height , spacing , typography that are proportional to the users default font size.
  Heres an example of how you can use rem units:

html {
  font-size: 16px; /* This is usually the default font size in most browsers */
}

.element {
  width: 10rem; /* The element will be 160px wide (10 * 16px) */
}
In this example, the .element will be 160px wide, regardless of the size of its parent element or the viewport.



    

Should you use percentages or rem units?

Whether you should use percentages or rem units depends on what you're trying to achieve. If you want your layout to adapt to the size of the parent element or the viewport, percentages can be a good choice. If you want your sizes to be proportional to the user's default font size, rem units can be a good choice.

In many cases, you might find yourself using a combination of both. For example, you might use percentages for widths and heights to create a responsive layout, and rem units for font sizes, margins, and paddings to ensure consistent spacing and typography across different devices.

Remember, the key to creating good responsive designs is to understand how these units work and to use the right unit for the right job.
