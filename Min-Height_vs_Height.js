Its important to note that percentage heights work best when the parent container on the view port  has an explicit height value specified, either in pixels (px) or rem another unit.





The decision on whether to use height or min-height in CSS depends on the specific needs of your design and the responsiveness of your website. Both properties have their uses, and understanding how they work can help you make an informed decision.

  HEIGHT
  ----------------
The height property sets a specific height for an element.
    However, when the content inside that element exceeds its height,
    it can result in overflow, which might cause your content to be cut off or a scrollbar to appear.


    
MIN-HEIGHT
  ----------------
On the other hand, the min-height property sets a minimum height for an element,
    but allows it to grow in height if the content inside it exceeds that minimum.
    This property can be useful for making sure that an element stays a certain height,
    while still allowing it to resize in response to its content developer.mozilla.org.
    

In terms of responsive design, min-height can be a better choice. 
    It can prevent issues with content overflow, especially on smaller screens or when the on-screen keyboard is involved.
    For example, if you set a min-height of 200px for an element, the element will never be smaller than 200px,
    but it will grow taller if the content inside it requires more space css-tricks.com.

.element {
  min-height: 200px;
}
However, its important to note that using height or min-height should be done with care. If youre creating a responsive design, you might want to consider using relative units like percentages or viewport units (vh, vw), instead of fixed units like pixels. This can help your design adapt better to different screen sizes stackoverflow.com.

For example, you might set a min-height in viewport units, which are relative to the size of the users viewport:

.element {
  min-height: 50vh; /* 50% of the viewport height */
}
In conclusion, whether you should use height or min-height depends on your specific needs. If you want an element to have a fixed height regardless of its content or the viewport size, use height. But if you want an element to be at least a certain height but also able to grow if its content requires more space, use min-height. 
  And for more responsive designs, consider using relative units instead of fixed units freecodecamp.org.
