To simulate different screen sizes and test the responsiveness of your website, you can use various tools, software, websites, or browsers. Here are a few options:

Responsive Design Mode in Browsers:

Most modern web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari, provide built-in developer tools with a responsive design mode.
In Chrome, you can access it by right-clicking on your website, selecting "Inspect", and then toggling the device toolbar icon (usually represented by a mobile and tablet icon).
In Firefox, you can open it by right-clicking on your website, selecting "Inspect Element", and then clicking the "Toggle Responsive Design Mode" icon (represented by a mobile and tablet icon).
In Safari, you can enable it by going to "Develop" in the menu bar, selecting "Enter Responsive Design Mode", and choosing a device size.
Browser Extensions:

There are browser extensions available, such as "Window Resizer" for Chrome or "Viewport Resizer" for Firefox, that allow you to resize your browser window to predefined or custom dimensions to simulate different screen sizes.
Online Responsive Testing Tools:

Websites like Responsinator (https://www.responsinator.com/), Am I Responsive (http://ami.responsivedesign.is/), or BrowserStack (https://www.browserstack.com/responsive) provide online tools to test the responsiveness of your website across various devices and screen sizes.
Device Emulators and Simulators:

Software like Android Studio (https://developer.android.com/studio) and Xcode (https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) provide emulators and simulators for testing your website on different mobile devices.
You can also use third-party tools like Blisk (https://blisk.io/) or Genymotion (https://www.genymotion.com/) to emulate mobile devices on your desktop.
These options should help you simulate different screen sizes and test the responsiveness of your website across a range of devices. Choose the method that suits your needs and workflow the best.
