The three video formats, MP4, WebM, and OGG, each have their own strengths and weaknesses. The choice between them depends on factors such as the target audiences browser compatibility, video quality, and size constraints.

MP4: This format is widely supported across a variety of platforms and devices, making it a reliable choice for broad compatibility. It provides a good balance between quality and size, and its compatible with several of the most popular codecs uploadcare.com.
WebM: WebM files are smaller in size compared to MP4, making them a good choice for web use. Theyre supported by most web browsers, and can provide improved web performance. However, they may not be as widely compatible with some devices as MP4 uploadcare.com.
OGG (Ogg Theora): While OGG is an open standard and is royalty-free, its not as widely supported as MP4 or WebM. It might be a good choice for specific cases where these factors are important, but for general use, MP4 and WebM are usually better choices uploadcare.com.
In terms of quality, both MP4 and WebM depend on the codec used. In general, MP4 (specifically with the H.264 codec) tends to produce better quality output than WebM (with the VP8 codec) at similar bitrates gumlet.com.

To reduce the video load on your website, consider the following strategies:

1. Use Multiple Formats: You can use both MP4 and WebM formats together. Serve WebM format whenever a browser supports it, and fall back to MP4 when it doesnt. This can be done using the video source tags, like so:

<video controls>
  <source src="movie.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
In this code, the browser will try to load the WebM video first. If it cannot, it will fall back to the MP4 video uploadcare.com.

2. Use Video Compression: Compress your videos to reduce their file size. Be aware that this might reduce video quality, so youll need to find a balance between size and quality that works for your specific needs.

3. Use the 'preload' Attribute: The 'preload' attribute in the video tag controls how (or if) the video should be loaded when the page loads. The options are 'auto', 'metadata', or 'none'. 'auto' tells the browser to load the entire video when the page loads, 'metadata' tells it to load only metadata, and 'none' tells it not to load the video when the page loads developer.mozilla.org.

<video controls preload="metadata">
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
In this code, only the metadata for the video is loaded when the page loads. The actual video data is only loaded when (and if) the user starts the video. This can help reduce the initial load on your website.

4. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN): A CDN can help deliver your video content more efficiently to users, reducing the load on your own servers. This is especially helpful for websites with a large amount of traffic or with users spread out geographically.

When choosing among the three video formats (MP4, WebM, and OGG), its best to use multiple formats to ensure broader browser compatibility. Different browsers have different levels of support for video formats, so providing multiple sources will increase the likelihood that your video will play on various devices and browsers.

Heres a recommended approach to reduce the video load on your website:

Use Multiple Video Formats: Provide your video in all three formats (MP4, WebM, and OGG) by using multiple <source> elements within the <video> tag.Browsers will automatically choose the supported format, so if one format isnt supported, the browser will try another until it finds a compatible one.

Video Compression: Optimize your video files to reduce their size without sacrificing quality. You can use video compression tools or online services to compress yourvideos before uploading them to your website. Smaller video files will load faster and put less strain on your server and your visitors internet connections.

Lazy Loading: Consider lazy-loading the video on your website. This means that the video will only start loading when its about to come into view (when the user scrolls to it). This can significantly improve the initial page load time, as the video wont be downloaded until necessary.

Shorter Video Length: If possible, try to keep your videos relatively short. Longer videos can increase the load time and may deter users from watching them entirely.

Use a Video Hosting Service: Consider using a video hosting service like YouTube or Vimeo to host your videos. These platforms handle video compression and delivery efficiently, which can reduce the load on your website server. You can then embed the video using the provided embed code.

Content Delivery Network (CDN): Use a CDN to deliver your video content. CDNs distribute your video files to multiple servers located around the world, reducing the distance between the user and the server, thus improving load times.

Responsive Videos: Use CSS and media queries to adjust the size of the video player based on the users device and screen size. Smaller devices can have smaller video players to optimize viewing and loading experiences.

By employing these techniques, you can significantly reduce the impact of videos on your websites load time and create a better user experience for your visitors.
