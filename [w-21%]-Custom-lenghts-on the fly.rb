Yes, you can use custom measurements in Tailwind CSS without customizing the framework. This is one of the powerful features available in Tailwind CSS v2.1 and later versions, when Just-In-Time (JIT) mode is enabled.

The feature allows you to specify arbitrary values directly in your styling using a specific syntax. This is done using square brackets within the class name. Here is a simple example:

<div class="w-[21%]">
  <!-- Your content here -->
</div>
In this example, w-[21] applies a width of 21% to the <div>. The same syntax can be used for a multitude of different CSS properties. Lets take a look at some examples:

For height:

<div class="h-[250px]">
  <!-- Your content here -->
</div>
For padding:

<div class="p-[15px]">
  <!-- Your content here -->
</div>
For margin:

<div class="m-[10px]">
  <!-- Your content here -->
</div>
Line-height:

<p class="leading-[1.75rem]">
  <!-- Your text here -->
</p>
And many others. You can also combine the arbitrary values feature with responsive design:

<div class="w-[30%] lg:w-[60%]">
  <!-- Your content here -->
</div>
In this example, the width of the <div> is 30% on medium screens and increases to 60% on large screens.

Although this allows for a lot of flexibility, it also increases the complexity of your code, which can make it harder to maintain and predict. Hence, its recommended to use this feature sparingly and to stick to predefined classes where possible.

Also note, in order for your custom arbitrary values to work, youll need to ensure youre using a version of Tailwind CSS that supports it (v2.1 and later) and youve enabled the Just-In-Time (JIT) mode in your tailwind.config.js file:

module.exports = {
  mode: "jit",
  // other stuff...
}
This JIT mode processes your code on demand as you save files — rather than producing a large set of default utilities at initial build time — which keeps your build super fast, gives you every utility you need, and none you don’t.

You can find more about this feature in the official Tailwind CSS documentation: Tailwind CSS Arbitrary Value Support.

  Yes, you can use custom measurements on the fly in Tailwind CSS without having to modify the framework or define new utility classes for each specific case. Tailwind supports a feature called "Customizing Spacing" that allows you to use arbitrary values for width, height, line height, padding, and margin.

To use custom measurements, you can wrap the measurement value in square brackets [ ] and then specify the desired measurement. For example:

html
Copy code
<div class="w-[21%]"></div>
In this example, the w-[21] class sets the width of the div to 21% of its parent containers width.

Here are some examples of how you can use custom measurements in different scenarios:

Custom Width:
html
Copy code
<div class="w-[200px]">Custom Width</div>
Custom Height:
html
Copy code
<div class="h-[50vh]">Custom Height</div>
Custom Line Height:
html
Copy code
<p class="leading-[1.6]">Custom Line Height</p>
Custom Padding:
html
Copy code
<div class="p-[10px]">Custom Padding</div>
Custom Margin:
html
Copy code
<div class="m-[20px]">Custom Margin</div>
You can use these custom measurements on any element where the corresponding utility classes are applicable. For example, w-[21%] for width, h-[50vh] for height, etc.

Keep in mind that while custom measurements can be convenient for one-off cases, Tailwinds predefined responsive classes and ratios (e.g., 1/2, 1/4, 2/3) are generally recommended for consistent and responsive designs. Custom measurements should be used sparingly, and for cases where specific, fixed measurements are necessary.

Using custom measurements in this way allows you to have more flexibility in your designs without the need to modify the Tailwind CSS framework itself. It enables you to apply ad-hoc styles as needed while still leveraging the power and speed of Tailwind's utility-first approach.
