JIT (Just-In-Time) mode in Tailwind CSS is a new compilation mode introduced in Tailwind CSS version 2.1. It provides an on-demand utility generation approach, where only the CSS classes you actually use in your HTML are compiled into your final CSS file. This results in significantly reduced file size, faster build times, and improved performance compared to the previous "Ahead-of-Time" (AOT) mode.

Heres what you need to know about JIT mode in Tailwind CSS and building a site with Next.js and Tailwind CSS:

Enabling JIT Mode:
To enable JIT mode, you need to update your tailwind.config.js file. Inside the file, set the mode option to 'jit':
js
Copy code
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'jit',
  // Other configuration options...
};

  Just-In-Time (JIT) mode is a feature introduced in Tailwind CSS version 2.1. This new compiler generates styles on demand as you write your templates, which is a significant change from the traditional approach where all styles are generated in advance during the initial build period blog.logrocket.com.

The JIT compiler provides several benefits:

Increased Performance: It significantly reduces build times and improves browser performance during development by only generating the CSS needed for the classes youre using in your code blog.logrocket.com.

Arbitrary Value Support: JIT mode allows you to use arbitrary values in your Tailwind CSS classes. This means you can use any custom value you want in your utility classes, such as top-[90px] or md:top-[120px] beyondco.de.

Improved Development Experience: If youre using the Tailwind CSS JIT CDN, all Tailwind classes get parsed on the fly, meaning you can add classes via the browser developer tools, and the CSS gets updated dynamically beyondco.de.

To enable JIT mode in your Next.js and Tailwind CSS project, you need to add mode: 'jit' to your Tailwind configuration file (tailwind.config.js):

module.exports = {
  mode: 'jit',
  purge: ['./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  // rest of the config
};
Then, when you run your process, you should pass an environment variable TAILWIND_MODE=watch to instruct Tailwind to continuously watch for file changes and rebuild behind the scenes egghead.io.
