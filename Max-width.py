Definition and Usage
The max-width property defines the maximum width of an element.

If the content is larger than the maximum width, it will automatically change the height of the element.

If the content is smaller than the maximum width, the max-width property has no effect.

Note: This prevents the value of the width property from becoming larger than max-width. The value of the max-width property overrides the width property.
